This is an early experiment with [ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com) for
blogging.  In contrast to, for example, WordPress, ruhoh is a *static*
blog generation tool.  That is, given properly formatted input
content, ruhoh *generates* the code for a static blog website.  There
has been a recent resurgence in the "static web". For example, it is
relatively straightforward to host your static website directly from
[AWS
S3](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2011/02/host-your-static-website-on-amazon-s3.html).  

### Simplicity

By definition, a static site has fewer moving parts than a dynamic
one.  While this might sacrifice some flexibility, if one has simple
needs this trade-off can be well worth it.

### Security 

Not to tempt fate, but there is not as much that can go horribly wrong
security-wise if you are simply serving static files.  Friends who
manage their own CMS-backed personal sites need to stay hyper-vigilant
about patching lest they find themselves unintentionally advertising
Russian Viagra.
